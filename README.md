### Hello there! I'll be doing the 30 Day Vanilla JS Challenge, by @wesbos! I'm uploading my answers along the way ðŸ˜Š

### Day one: JS Drum Kit

Created a drum kit. When you play one of the available keys on your keyboard, it makes a sound. Learned a little about
Event Listeners and how to do things without JQuery, only vanilla JavaScript.

### Day two: JS and CSS Clock

Created an analog clock that works according to your computer time. Learned about CSS' transition & transform.

### Day three: CSS Variables

This time, I learned about the global scope CSS variables, and how you can update their values with JS. Using this concept, it was possible to create a sort of interactive picture, where you can define the size and color of the borders, besides the blur, using HTML'S range input types. Also got to know data attributes (store custom data) and dataset (an object that will contain all the data attributes of that specific element).

### Day four: Array Cardio day 1

Practiced and learned a bunch of array methods! Like sort and reduce.

### Day five: Flex Panel Gallery

Reviewed some CSS' flex properties and classList.toggle, applied when you click on an expandable panel.

### Day six: Type Ahead

Learned about Fetch API, getting .json() from fetch response, ES6 spread operator.

### Day seven: Array Cardio day 2

More array methods!

### Day eight: Fun with HTML5 Canvas

Today was really fun! Learned a bunch about HTML canvas, mouse events and flags.
