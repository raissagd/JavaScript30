### Hello there! I'll be doing the 30 Day Vanilla JS Challenge, by @wesbos! I'm uploading my answers along the way ðŸ˜Š

### ðŸ‘‰ Day one:

<details markdown='1'><summary>JS Drum Kit</summary>
Thoughts: Created a drum kit. When you play one of the available keys on your keyboard, it makes a sound. Learned a little about
Event Listeners and how to do things without JQuery, only vanilla JavaScript.
</details>
<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ Day two:

<details markdown='1'><summary>JS and CSS Clock</summary>
Thoughts: Created an analog clock that works according to your computer time. Learned about CSS' transition & transform.
</details>
<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ Day three:

<details markdown='1'><summary>CSS Variables</summary>
Thoughts: This time, I learned about the global scope CSS variables, and how you can update their values with JS. Using this concept, it was possible to create a sort of interactive picture, where you can define the size and color of the borders, besides the blur, using HTML'S range input types. Also got to know data attributes (store custom data) and dataset (an object that will contain all the data attributes of that specific element).

</details>
<br />

</details>
<br />

<details markdown='1'><summary>Type Ahead</summary>

</details>
<br />
